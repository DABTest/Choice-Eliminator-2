    <p>I will be removing Choice Eliminator form the add-on store at the end of Feburary.   Google changed some 
    things when they released new forms that have made CE very unreliable.   I have done my best, but I do not believe 
    I can make it work any better, and I don't like offering a product I personally do not reccomend using.</p>
    
    <p>I will change it to link-only.  This means it should still stay installed for people who have already have it installed, 
    but it will not be found in the add-on store.   If new users really want it, they will have to go to my website and 
    click the install link from there.</p>
   <p>
    Very Sorry,<br>

    <!-- <p>Choice Eliminator is not reliable when multiple people are taking the form at the same time. </p>
    
    <p>I have done the best I could but something changed when Google launched the new forms and 
    the trick I used by stting the question to required no longer prevents a submission if someone 
    else has already selected a choice. Now even if the form is old or new the issues is still there.</p>
    
    <p>This means that if two people are taking the form at the same time and have the form up.  
    If person A selects 8:00 and submits, even if person B doesn't submit to several minutes later
    (or even the next day if they don't close the form), and also selects 8:00 it will go through
    as if the option was still availble.</p> -->
